I don't even know why I posted this here lol, skid, you won't get anything out of it and never get a working gen
if ur a dev, do your own research, reverse hcaptcha, make a realistic movement data gen and that's it, if you want you can use this as a bit of help for your research but I would say that 40/60 per min is pretty slow lol, if you have a solver that solves in lets say worst case 10s, you can thread all this up and get a lot more tokens than that.

why leaking ?
